# IML_Project
Online Payment Fraudulent Detection Using Machine Learning in Python.

The project aims to develop a fraud detection system for online payments using Python-based machine learning. Methodology includes exploratory data analysis, supervised learning algorithms, and evaluation metrics to gauge model efficacy. Once trained, the final model is deployed for real-time fraud detection, aiming to reduce financial losses and ensure secure transactions.
