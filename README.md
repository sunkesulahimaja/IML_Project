# IML_Project
Online Payment Fraudulent Detection Using Machine Learning in Python.

As online transactions continue to grow, risk of fraudulent activities in online payments have become an area of increasing concern for many businesses. Thus, countermeasures have to be taken. 
One such measure includes designing an ML model to identify fraudulent transactions.
Our project aims to develop a fraud detection system for online payments using Python-based machine learning. 

Methodology includes exploratory data analysis, supervised learning algorithms, and evaluation metrics to gauge model efficacy. Once trained, the final model is deployed for real-time fraud detection, aiming to reduce financial losses and ensure secure transactions.
