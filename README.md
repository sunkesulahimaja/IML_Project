Online Payment Fraudulent Detection Using Machine Learning in Python.

As online transactions continue to grow, the risk of fraudulent activities in online payments has become a significant concern for many businesses. To address this challenge, our project aims to develop a fraud detection system for online payments using machine learning techniques in Python.

Overview

The project methodology includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), supervised learning algorithms, and evaluation metrics to gauge model efficacy. By leveraging machine learning, we aim to reduce financial losses and ensure secure transactions in real-time.
