Online Payment Fraudulent Detection Using Machine Learning in Python.
---

As online transactions continue to grow, the risk of fraudulent activities in online payments has become a significant concern for many businesses. To address this challenge, our project aims to develop a fraud detection system for online payments using machine learning techniques in Python.

Overview
---
The project methodology includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), supervised learning algorithms like Random Forest, SVM, MLP,and Decision Trees, and evaluation metrics to gauge model efficacy. By leveraging machine learning, we aim to reduce financial losses and ensure secure transactions in real-time.
Our project also explores the idea of using Unsupervised learning using K-Means to solve the same problem, results of which have been analysed.

Dependencies
---
We have leveraged several powerful libraries to build our solution:
1. For data processing and manipulation, we utilized popular libraries such as NumPy and Pandas.
2. Scikit-learn was instrumental in implementing various machine learning algorithms, enabling us to train and evaluate our models efficiently.
3. For visualization purposes, we employed Matplotlib and Seaborn, which allowed us to create insightful plots and graphs to better understand our data and model performance.
4. Additionally, we utilized the Tabulate library to present results and summaries in a structured format, enhancing readability and comprehension for stakeholders.

2. ipynb of Decision Trees, SVM, MLP and K-Means: IMLProj_Models.ipynb
3. A detailed report encapsulating the intricacies of the project: Report_IML.docx
   
Our project separates Random Forest Model training from the rest based on aggregated results. What we aim to train further, is the Random Forest Model which provided promising results.

Getting Started
---
Use the following steps to begin utilizing the models and examining the project report:

1. Make a local copy of the repository on your PC (Clone the repo)
2. Open the project directory.
3. Examine the ipynb files:
   a.IML_Project_RandomForest.ipynb
   b. IMLProj_Models.ipynb
4. Examine the project report.

Right now we have a robust machine learning model, but our ultimate future goal is to develop a real-time fraud detection system equipped with continuous monitoring capabilities. This system will enable timely identification and prevention of fraudulent activities, further enhancing the security of online transactions.

We welcome community contributions to improve and sustain the project.
